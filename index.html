									<h2>A developer, student, and leader.</h2>

									<p> I am a college student studying <span>Computer Science</span> at <span>University of California, San Diego</span>, graduating in June 2022. 
										Ever since I was a kid, I'd always been in love with technology. I learned how to code 
										during junior year of high school. And since then, I've become a Software Engineer, committed 
										to learning as much as I can about technology, and providing others the opportunity to code by
										running technical workshops. In my spare time, I like to play Super Smash Bros Ultimate
										(Mario main), take lots of photos, travel, and eat tons of food with friends.
									</p>
									<br>

									<p> My belief has always been that anybody in the world is capable of making a difference. I'm always excited to meet new people, because I enjoy
										hearing other people's experiences. This philsophy is encapsulated within one of my favorite quotes:
									</p>

									<p class="quote"> "Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine." - Alan Turing, The Imitation Game</p>

									<p> I am always seeking new opportunities. Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to work 
										together, or if you just have any questions about my experiences. </p>

									<p>As an intern with the Google Admin Console Enterprise Team, I finished two projects. First, I developed several features which allowed
										other Googlers to view and perform actions on database content, directly from the UI. Secondly, my partner and I created an error injection feature, allowing 
										other Googlers to insert errors into the UI, immediately being able to view the UI's response in that situation. During this experience, I wrote unit tests, integration tests, 
										developed several design documents, and submitted numerous code reviews. </p>

									<p>ACM UCSD (or Association for Computing Machinery) is computing organization with the goal of promoting computing excellence to all people interested in technology. I was part of a group of 10 people who felt that a computing 
										community was much needed on campus, and thus we founded ACM UCSD. My role in this org is to teach workshops, most of which focus on web development. I have taught 10+ workshops to 250+ students, about topics such as the 
										MERN Stack, HTML/CSS, and Deployment, and plan to teach a total of 20 workshops to 700+ students by the end of the school year.

									<h2>Data Technical IT Assistant<br><i>November 2018 - Present</i></h2>
									<p>As a developer for the Student Financial Solutions department for UCSD, I've developed & troubleshooted several technical projects which help make processes more efficient. 
										First, I developed and troubleshooted a credit card refund processer using Microsoft Access, used by workers who fulfill refunds requested by students at school. I've also 
										started the development of a refund generator web application. Most notably, I've developed several C# Windows Applications, using the HostExplorer library to allow workers
										to submit thousands of pieces of data through one application. Throughout these projects, I've had to communicate with the team to understand the features needed from the 
										application and maintained several documents of project documentation and analysis.
